I have great respect for the young players coming up today, but I'm not sure they understand how much work it takes to get where we are. There's a lot of talent out there now, and that makes me happy because more people can reach their potential if given enough time and guidance. But what worries me is when these guys think success will come easily just because other teams use similar strategies or play in certain ways. They don't realize yet why some things worked then didn't later on down the road. It’s all about finding your own path while learning from others' experiences along the way. So yes, there may be similarities between different rosters around the league right now – whether you're talking about L.A., Toronto, Seattle - but every team has its unique identity based upon who they have playing together at any one moment. And I believe that's where true greatness lies; it comes not so much from copying someone else exactly as being able to adapt and change according to new circumstances. That takes discipline, hard work, and a willingness to learn something new each day. But most importantly, it requires an unshakable belief in yourself no matter what happens on or off the court. Because if your confidence isn't strong enough then nothing will ever feel possible no matter how good
