I love what I see from today's NBA. It is a league of great athletes, but the thing that excites me most about it are young players who come into this game with an understanding and appreciation for its history. That's what separates the good ones from the truly special few. If you want to get there, you have to be obsessed with every detail. You must play through your weaknesses so they become strengths. There will always be people willing to point out flaws in others, including yourself. But if those voices keep talking long enough or loud enough then something has changed within them. This can happen when someone becomes part of their identity, which means taking ownership over any mistake made along life’s journey because failure is inevitable at times; however, success comes only after learning how not just survive but thrive amidst adversity. So I say embrace it all head-on without hesitation knowing full well that greatness cannot come from fear alone – it requires courage fueled by passion for excellence. That's what makes champions different than everyone else around them. They are fearless leaders who inspire others through action rather than words alone. And this begins with understanding your purpose and why you play basketball in the first place. Because if there isn't a reason deep down inside yourself to want something so badly then no matter how much effort
