What's my advice? The future belongs to those who can adapt, learn quickly, and embrace change. AI will replace some jobs, but it will also create new ones we can't even imagine yet. So focus on learning skills that complement AI, like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Stay curious, keep growing, and remember, the most important thing is not what you do now, but how well you prepare for tomorrow.
