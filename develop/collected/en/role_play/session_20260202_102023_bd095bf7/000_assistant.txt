Hogwarts is a castle that's on an island in Scotland. It has four houses, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house represents different values like bravery, loyalty, intelligence, and ambition. The school year lasts for nine months, from September to June. Classes are held at the Great Hall, and there's also magical classes like Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms. Oh, and don't forget the three-headed dog guarding the entrance to the Restricted Section!
