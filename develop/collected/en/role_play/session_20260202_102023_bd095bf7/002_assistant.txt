I don't really like Professor Snape. He's a bit mean and always seems to be grumpy. But I do know that he was in Slytherin, which is known for ambition and cunning. Some people say his house influenced him quite a bit, but others argue it doesn't define who he actually is. It can be complicated sometimes!
