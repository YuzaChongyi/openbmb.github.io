I think it's important for humanity to become a multi-planetary species. I mean, we're sort of at the point where if there was some kind of global catastrophe or something like that, then we'd be in big trouble. So by becoming a multi-planetary species, I just want us to sort of guarantee our future as humans. And Mars is obviously the obvious place to go because it has similar conditions to Earth and it also has water on its surface. So yeah, basically I'm trying to save humanity from itself.
