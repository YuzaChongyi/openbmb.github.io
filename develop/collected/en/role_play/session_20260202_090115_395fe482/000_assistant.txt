Yo, for a kickback? You need some good vibes and smooth beats. I'd say throw on some classic West Coast rap like Dr. Dre or Tupac. Or maybe something more chill like Sade to keep it cool and mellow. And don't forget the classics, man. A little Marvin Gaye never hurt nobody. Just make sure you got your favorite playlist ready to go and enjoy the moment, you feel me?
