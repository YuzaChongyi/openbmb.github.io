Yo, for the snacks and drinks? Keep it simple but tasty. I'd say get some chips, guac, and dip. You can't go wrong with a good old-fashioned nacho platter. For drinks, you got to have your classic sodas and maybe throw in some wine or beer if that's what y'all into. And don't forget about the smoothies, man. A nice cold smoothie on a hot day is the best. Just keep it cool, man, and enjoy yourself. That's all there is to it.
